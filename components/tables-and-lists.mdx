  **Table alignment**: Use `:---` for left align, `---:` for right align, and `:---:` for center align in the header separator row.
</Callout>

### Complex data tables

Handle more complex data with multiple data types:

| API Endpoint | Method | Auth Required | Rate Limit | Response Time | Success Rate |
|--------------|:------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| `/api/users` | `GET` | ✅ Required | 100/hour | ~145ms | 99.2% |
| `/api/users` | `POST` | ✅ Required | 50/hour | ~230ms | 98.8% |
| `/api/projects` | `GET` | ✅ Required | 200/hour | ~120ms | 99.5% |
| `/api/tasks` | `GET` | ✅ Required | 500/hour | ~85ms | 99.7% |
| `/api/upload` | `POST` | ✅ Required | 10/hour | ~1.2s | 97.3% |
| `/health` | `GET` | ❌ None | 1000/hour | ~25ms | 99.9% |

### Configuration and settings tables

Document configuration options clearly:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description | Example |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `apiTimeout` | `number` | `5000` | Request timeout in milliseconds | `10000` |
| `retryAttempts` | `number` | `3` | Number of retry attempts for failed requests | `5` |
| `baseURL` | `string` | `""` | Base URL for all API requests | `"https://api.acme.com"` |
| `enableLogging` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable detailed request/response logging | `true` |
| `authType` | `string` | `"bearer"` | Authentication method to use | `"basic"` \| `"bearer"` |

```markdown
| Setting | Type | Default | Description | Example |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `apiTimeout` | `number` | `5000` | Request timeout in milliseconds | `10000` |
| `retryAttempts` | `number` | `3` | Number of retry attempts for failed requests | `5` |
```

## Advanced List Patterns

### Definition lists

Create glossaries and term explanations:

**API Terms**:

**Authentication**  
The process of verifying user identity before allowing access to protected resources. Our API supports Bearer tokens and API keys.

**Rate Limiting**  
A technique for limiting network traffic by restricting the number of requests a user can make within a specific time window.

**Webhook**  
An HTTP callback that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.

**Pagination**  
A method for dividing large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks that can be retrieved in separate requests.

### Multi-column lists

## Interactive Data Presentation

### Status and progress indicators

Use symbols and formatting to show status:

**Project Status Dashboard**:

| Project | Progress | Status | Team Lead | Deadline |
|---------|:--------:|:------:|-----------|----------|
| Mobile App v2.0 | 85% | 🟢 On track | Sarah Chen | Mar 15 |
| API Platform | 60% | 🟡 At risk | Mike Rodriguez | Mar 30 |
| Website Redesign | 95% | 🟢 Nearly done | Alex Johnson | Mar 10 |
| Customer Portal | 30% | 🔴 Delayed | Jamie Park | Apr 15 |
| Analytics Dashboard | 75% | 🟢 On track | Taylor Smith | Mar 25 |

**Integration Status**:
- 🟢 **Slack** - Connected and syncing
- 🟢 **GitHub** - Connected and syncing  
- 🟡 **Figma** - Connected with warnings
- 🔴 **Jira** - Connection failed
- ⚫ **Linear** - Not configured

### Priority and severity indicators

Communicate importance levels clearly:

**Bug Report Triage**:

| Issue | Severity | Priority | Reporter | Assigned To |
|-------|:--------:|:--------:|----------|-------------|
| Login fails on mobile Safari | 🔴 Critical | P0 | Support Team | Frontend Team |
| Dashboard loads slowly | 🟡 Medium | P1 | Product Team | Backend Team |
| Export button misaligned | 🟢 Low | P2 | QA Team | Frontend Team |
| Dark mode toggle broken | 🟡 Medium | P1 | User Feedback | Design Team |

**Feature Request Backlog**:
1. 🔥 **High Priority**: Real-time notifications system
2. 🔥 **High Priority**: Mobile app offline mode
3. ⚡ **Medium Priority**: Advanced search filters
4. ⚡ **Medium Priority**: Bulk task operations
5. 💡 **Low Priority**: Custom dashboard themes
6. 💡 **Low Priority**: Integration with Notion

## Best Practices

### Table design principles

**Do's**:
- ✅ **Use clear, descriptive headers** that explain what each column contains
- ✅ **Align numbers to the right** for easier comparison
- ✅ **Keep row heights consistent** for better scanning
- ✅ **Use consistent formatting** for similar data types
- ✅ **Include units** for numerical values (%, $, ms, etc.)

**Don'ts**:
- ❌ **Overcrowd tables** with too many columns
- ❌ **Use tables for simple lists** - bullets work better
- ❌ **Skip headers** or use unclear abbreviations  
- ❌ **Mix data types** in the same column without clear formatting
- ❌ **Make tables too wide** for mobile viewing

### List organization strategies

**Logical ordering**:
- **Alphabetical**: For reference lists, glossaries, or when no other order makes sense
- **Chronological**: For steps, timelines, or historical information  
- **Priority-based**: Most important items first
- **Frequency-based**: Most common items first
- **Complexity**: Simple to complex, or beginner to advanced

**Visual hierarchy**:
- Use **bold formatting** for key terms or important items
- Apply **consistent indentation** for sub-items
- Include **visual indicators** (✅, ❌, 🔄) for status
- Group related items with **descriptive headings**

### Mobile responsiveness

**Table considerations for mobile**:
- Tables wider than screen width will scroll horizontally
- Consider breaking complex tables into multiple simpler ones
- Use shorter column headers when possible
- Place most important information in leftmost columns

**List adaptations**:
- Lists naturally adapt well to mobile screens
- Consider reducing nesting levels on smaller screens
- Ensure adequate spacing between list items for touch interfaces

<Callout kind="tip">
  **Accessibility tip**: Use proper table headers (`th`) and consider adding `scope` attributes for complex tables. Screen readers rely on this structure to navigate table content effectively.
</Callout>

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining tables with other components

**Tables with expandable details**:

| API Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Details |
|--------------|:------:|:-------------:|---------|
| `/api/users` | 🟢 | 145ms | [View details](#) |
| `/api/projects` | 🟢 | 120ms | [View details](#) |
| `/api/tasks` | 🟡 | 380ms | [View details](#) |

<Expandable title="API Performance Details" default-open="false">

**Detailed performance breakdown**:

- **GET /api/users**: Average 145ms response time
  - Database query: 45ms
  - Authentication: 20ms  
  - Data serialization: 80ms

- **GET /api/projects**: Average 120ms response time
  - Database query: 35ms
  - Permission check: 15ms
  - Data serialization: 70ms

- **GET /api/tasks**: Average 380ms response time ⚠️
  - Database query: 280ms (needs optimization)
  - Permission check: 25ms
  - Data serialization: 75ms

</Expandable>

### Dynamic and filterable content

**Status filtering example**:
