### Feature documentation with examples

Combine explanations with live examples:

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="📊 Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">

**Basic search**:
- `project management` - Find pages containing both words
- `"exact phrase"` - Find pages with the exact phrase
- `author:john` - Find content created by John

**Advanced operators**:
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` - Combine search terms
- `*` - Wildcard matching (`integr*` matches "integration", "integrate")
- `type:task` - Search specific content types
- `created:2024` - Find content created in 2024

**Search examples**:
```
api AND documentation NOT deprecated
"getting started" OR tutorial  
author:sarah type:project created:2024-01
integr* AND slack
```

**Pro tips**:
- Use quotes for multi-word terms
- Combine multiple filters for precise results
- Save frequent searches for quick access
- Search supports real-time results as you type

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🔄 Automation Rules" default-open="false">

**Auto-assignment rules**:

Create rules to automatically assign tasks based on criteria:

```javascript
// Example: Auto-assign bug reports to QA team
{
  "trigger": "task_created",
  "conditions": {
    "labels": ["bug"],
    "priority": ["high", "critical"]
  },
  "actions": {
    "assign_to": "qa_team",
    "notify": ["team_lead"],
    "add_labels": ["needs_triage"]
  }
}
```

**Status automation**:

Move tasks automatically based on events:

```javascript
// Example: Move to testing when PR is merged
{
  "trigger": "github_pr_merged",
  "actions": {
    "move_to_status": "ready_for_testing",
    "notify_assignee": true,
    "add_comment": "PR merged, ready for QA testing"
  }
}
```

**Setup instructions**:
1. Go to Settings → Automation
2. Click "Create New Rule"  
3. Define trigger conditions
4. Specify actions to take
5. Test with sample data
6. Enable the rule

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="🎨 Custom Themes and Branding" default-open="false">

**Brand colors**:

Customize your workspace appearance:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "light": {
      "brand": "#3b82f6",      // Primary brand color
      "accent": "#1d4ed8",     // Secondary accent  
      "success": "#10b981",    // Success messages
      "warning": "#f59e0b",    // Warning alerts
      "error": "#ef4444"       // Error messages
    },
    "dark": {
      "brand": "#60a5fa",      // Adjusted for dark mode
      "accent": "#3b82f6",
      "success": "#34d399", 
      "warning": "#fbbf24",
      "error": "#f87171"
    }
  }
}
```

**Logo requirements**:

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Best Practices

### Content organization strategy

**Logical grouping**:
- Group related topics together in ExpandableGroups
- Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate what's inside
- Order items from most common to least common
- Consider your users' mental model and workflow

**Progressive disclosure**:
- Start with essential information visible
- Use `default-open="true"` sparingly for critical items
- Hide advanced or detailed information in expandables
- Provide clear section previews in titles

### Writing effective expandable titles

**Good title examples**:
- ✅ "How do I reset my password?" (clear question)
- ✅ "Setting up GitHub integration" (specific task)  
- ✅ "Troubleshooting login errors" (clear scope)
- ✅ "API rate limits and quotas" (specific topic)

**Poor title examples**:
- ❌ "More information" (vague)
- ❌ "Click here" (non-descriptive)
- ❌ "Advanced" (unclear what's advanced)
- ❌ "Other stuff" (meaningless)

### When to use expandables vs. separate pages

**Use expandables for**:
- FAQ sections with short answers
- Optional details that supplement main content  
- Step-by-step processes with logical breaks
- Troubleshooting guides with multiple solutions
- Supplementary information that not everyone needs

**Use separate pages for**:
- Complete topics that deserve dedicated space
- Content that needs its own URL for linking/bookmarking
- Long-form guides or tutorials
- Content that forms part of a logical navigation flow
- Information that needs to rank in search results

<Callout kind="tip">
  **Accessibility consideration**: Expandable components are fully keyboard accessible and work with screen readers. The expand/collapse state is announced to assistive technologies.
</Callout>

## Advanced Techniques

### Nested content organization

Create sophisticated information architectures:

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="API Documentation" default-open="false">

**Authentication**:
<Expandable title="Bearer Token Authentication" default-open="false">

Include your API token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://api.acme.com/users
```

**Token management**:
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens are valid for 30 days  
- Store tokens securely (never in client-side code)

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="API Key Authentication" default-open="false">

Pass your API key as a header or query parameter:

```bash
# As header (recommended)
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.acme.com/users

# As query parameter  
curl "https://api.acme.com/users?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</Expandable>

**Rate Limits**:
- 1000 requests per hour for authenticated requests
- 100 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests  
- Rate limit headers included in all responses

**Error Handling**:
- Standard HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages in JSON format
- Request IDs for troubleshooting

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Integration Guides" default-open="false">

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Slack Integration Setup" default-open="false">

**Step 1**: Install the app from Slack App Directory  
**Step 2**: Authorize permissions for your workspace  
**Step 3**: Configure notification preferences  
**Step 4**: Test the integration with a sample notification

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="GitHub Integration Setup" default-open="false">

**Step 1**: Install the GitHub app on your repositories  
**Step 2**: Configure webhook URLs in your repository settings  
**Step 3**: Map GitHub issues to project tasks  
**Step 4**: Enable automatic task creation from pull requests

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="warning">
  **Avoid deep nesting**: While technically possible, avoid nesting expandables more than 2-3 levels deep. It creates poor user experience and can confuse navigation.
</Callout>

### Dynamic content with CodeGroups

Combine expandables with tabbed content:

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Multi-language Code Examples" default-open="false">

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python,Go">
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK implementation
const client = new ApiClient({
  token: 'your-api-token',
  baseURL: 'https://api.acme.com'
});

async function getUsers() {
  try {
    const response = await client.get('/users');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch users:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

```python
# Python SDK implementation
from api_client import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(
    token='your-api-token',
    base_url='https://api.acme.com'
)

def get_users():
    try:
        response = client.get('/users')
        return response.json()
    except Exception as error:
        print(f'Failed to fetch users: {error}')
        raise
```

```go
// Go SDK implementation
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/your-company/api-client-go"
)

func main() {
    client := apiclient.New(apiclient.Config{
        Token:   "your-api-token",
        BaseURL: "https://api.acme.com",
    })

    users, err := client.GetUsers()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to fetch users: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Retrieved %d users\n", len(users))
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Each SDK provides the same functionality with language-specific conventions and error handling patterns.
