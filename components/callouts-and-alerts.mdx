Draw attention to important information with visually distinct callout boxes. Documentation.AI's callout components help you highlight tips, warnings, errors, and other critical information.

## Basic Callout Types

### Info callouts

Use info callouts for helpful context, explanations, or additional details:

<Callout kind="info">
  **Getting started**: New to our platform? Check out our [quickstart guide](../getting-started/quickstart) to set up your account in under 10 minutes.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="info">
  The API rate limit is 1000 requests per hour per API key. Contact support if you need higher limits for production use.
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="info">

</Callout>
```

### Tip callouts

Share helpful tips, best practices, and recommendations:

<Callout kind="tip">
  **Pro tip**: Use environment variables to store API keys instead of hardcoding them in your application. This keeps your credentials secure and makes deployment easier.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Enable browser notifications to get real-time updates when team members comment on your tasks or when deadlines are approaching.
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="tip">
  **Pro tip**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables rather than hardcoding values.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Enable browser notifications to get real-time updates when team members comment on your tasks or when deadlines are approaching.
</Callout>
```

### Success callouts

Celebrate achievements, confirm successful operations, or highlight positive outcomes:

<Callout kind="success">
  **Congratulations!** Your workspace has been successfully created. You can now invite team members and start your first project.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="success">
  **Integration complete**: Your GitHub repository is now connected. Pull requests will automatically create tasks in your project.
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="success">
  **Success!** Your setup is complete. You can now start using the platform.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="success">
  **Integration complete**: Your GitHub repository is now connected. Pull requests will automatically create tasks in your project.
</Callout>
```

### Alert callouts

Use alert callouts for important warnings, cautions, or things users should pay attention to:

<Callout kind="alert">
  **Important**: Changing your workspace subdomain will affect all existing bookmarks and shared links. Make sure to update any saved URLs.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="alert">
  **Breaking change in v2.0**: The `createUser()` function now requires an email parameter. Update your code before upgrading.
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="alert">
  **Important**: Changes to your configuration may affect existing integrations.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="alert">
  **Breaking change in v2.0**: API function signatures have been updated. Review the migration guide.
</Callout>
```

### Danger callouts

Reserve danger callouts for critical warnings about destructive actions or serious issues:

<Callout kind="danger">
  **Warning**: Deleting your workspace is permanent and cannot be undone. All projects, tasks, and data will be lost forever.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="danger">
  **Security alert**: Never commit API keys or passwords to version control. Use environment variables or secure key management systems instead.
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="danger">
  **Warning**: Destructive operations cannot be undone. Make sure you have backups.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="danger">
  **Security alert**: Keep credentials secure and never expose them in code repositories.
</Callout>
```

## Advanced Callout Usage

### Rich content callouts

Callouts can contain any markdown content including lists, code, and links:

<Callout kind="info">
  **Setting up your development environment**:
  
  1. **Install Node.js 16+** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
  2. **Clone the repository**:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/your-project.git
     cd your-project
     ```
  3. **Install dependencies**:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
  4. **Start the development server**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
  
  The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
</Callout>

```jsx
<Callout kind="info">
  **Development setup example**:
  
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Configure environment variables  
  3. Start the development server
  4. Open your browser to localhost:3000
  
  Full setup instructions are available in our guide.
</Callout>
```

### Multi-paragraph callouts

Use callouts for longer explanations that span multiple paragraphs:

<Callout kind="tip">
  **Understanding API versioning**

  Our API uses semantic versioning to ensure backward compatibility while allowing for new features and improvements.

  **Version format**: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
  - **Major version** changes include breaking changes to existing endpoints
  - **Minor version** changes add new features without breaking existing functionality  
  - **Patch version** changes include bug fixes and small improvements

  **Current version**: v2.1.3  
  **Supported versions**: v2.x.x (all minor and patch versions)  
  **Deprecated versions**: v1.x.x (support ends December 2024)

  We recommend always using the latest minor version to get the newest features and security updates.
</Callout>

### Nested callouts (use sparingly)

In rare cases, you might need to nest callouts for complex information hierarchies:

<Callout kind="info">
  **Database migration guide**

  Follow these steps carefully when migrating to the new database schema:

  <Callout kind="alert">
    **Before you start**: Create a complete backup of your database. This process modifies existing data and cannot be easily reversed.
  </Callout>

  1. Run the migration script
  2. Verify data integrity
  3. Update your application configuration

  <Callout kind="success">
    **Migration complete**: Your database is now using the new schema. Performance should improve by approximately 30%.
  </Callout>
</Callout>

<Callout kind="warning">
  **Best practice**: Avoid nesting callouts more than one level deep, as it can create visual confusion and reduce readability.
</Callout>

## Callout Best Practices

### When to use each type

| Callout Type | Use For | Examples |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Info** | Context, explanations, additional details | API limits, feature availability, related resources |
| **Tip** | Best practices, recommendations, helpful hints | Performance optimizations, workflow suggestions |
| **Success** | Positive confirmation, achievements, completions | Successful setup, feature enabled, task completed |
| **Alert** | Important warnings, attention-required items | Breaking changes, important updates, cautions |  
| **Danger** | Critical warnings, destructive actions | Data loss warnings, security issues, permanent actions |

### Writing effective callout content

**Do's**:
- ✅ **Start with a clear heading** that summarizes the main point
- ✅ **Use action-oriented language** for things users need to do
- ✅ **Include specific examples** when explaining concepts
- ✅ **Provide next steps or links** for users who want more information
- ✅ **Keep content scannable** with bullets, short paragraphs, and formatting

**Don'ts**:
- ❌ **Overuse callouts** - too many reduces their impact
- ❌ **Use danger callouts for minor issues** - save them for truly critical warnings  
- ❌ **Bury important information** in long callout text
- ❌ **Use vague language** like "be careful" without explaining why
- ❌ **Skip the heading** - readers scan callouts quickly and need context

### Callout placement strategy

**Strategic placement**:
- **Beginning of sections** - Set expectations or provide context
- **Before code examples** - Explain what the code does or prerequisites
- **After instructions** - Confirm success or provide troubleshooting
- **End of sections** - Summarize key points or provide next steps

**Avoid placing callouts**:
- In the middle of step-by-step instructions (breaks flow)
- Too close together (creates visual noise)
- For information better suited to regular text

## Callout Accessibility

### Screen reader considerations

Callouts are marked up with proper ARIA labels to ensure they're accessible:

- **Info callouts**: Marked as informational content
- **Tip callouts**: Marked as helpful hints  
- **Success callouts**: Marked as positive status messages
- **Alert callouts**: Marked as important warnings
- **Danger callouts**: Marked as critical alerts that demand attention

### Visual accessibility

- **Color coding**: Each callout type uses distinct colors that meet WCAG contrast requirements
- **Icons**: Visual icons supplement color coding for users with color blindness
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy and readable font sizes
- **Focus states**: Keyboard navigation support with visible focus indicators

## Integration with Other Components

### Callouts with code examples

<Callout kind="tip">
  **Performance optimization**: Use connection pooling to improve database performance:

  ```javascript
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    max: 20,  // Maximum connections
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
  });
  ```

  This reduces connection overhead and improves response times by up to 40%.
</Callout>

### Callouts with expandable content

<Callout kind="info">
  **Advanced configuration options**:

  <Expandable title="Environment-specific settings" default-open="false">
  
  Configure different settings for development, staging, and production:

  ```yaml
  # config/development.yml
  database:
    pool_size: 5
    timeout: 5000
    
  # config/production.yml  
  database:
    pool_size: 25
    timeout: 10000
    ssl: true
  ```

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Custom authentication providers" default-open="false">
  
  Set up custom SSO providers for enterprise customers:

  1. Configure your identity provider
  2. Add SAML metadata to your workspace settings
  3. Test the authentication flow
  4. Enable for all team members

  </Expandable>
</Callout>
