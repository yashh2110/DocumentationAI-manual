## Step 3: Team Setup

### Adding team members

There are several ways to add people to your workspace:

<CodeGroup uid="7509e359-5bf9-4a8a-bf7f-2f56cf3aa3a6" show-lines="true" tabs={[]}>
  ```javascript
  // Individual email invites
  const inviteUsers = [
    {
      email: "john@acme.com",
      role: "member",
      projects: ["proj_123", "proj_456"]
    },
    {
      email: "admin@acme.com", 
      role: "admin",
      projects: "all"
    }
  ];

  // Send invitations
  inviteUsers.forEach(user => {
    sendInvitation(user);
  });
  ```

  ```csv
  # CSV bulk import format
  email,role,department,projects
  john.doe@acme.com,member,engineering,proj_123
  jane.smith@acme.com,admin,product,all
  bob.wilson@acme.com,viewer,marketing,proj_456
  ```

  ```xml
  <!-- SCIM provisioning for enterprise -->
  <scim:User>
    <scim:userName>john.doe@acme.com</scim:userName>
    <scim:name>
      <scim:givenName>John</scim:givenName>
      <scim:familyName>Doe</scim:familyName>
    </scim:name>
    <scim:emails>
      <scim:email primary="true">john.doe@acme.com</scim:email>
    </scim:emails>
  </scim:User>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Role assignment strategy

Plan your role structure before adding team members:

**Recommended approach for most teams**:

| Team Size    | Admins | Members          | Viewers                |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2-10 people  | 1-2    | Everyone else    | External stakeholders  |
| 10-50 people | 2-3    | Team leads + ICs | Contractors, clients   |
| 50+ people   | 3-5    | Department leads | Read-only stakeholders |

### Department and project organization

Organize team members by department and assign to relevant projects:

1. **Create departments** (Settings → Team → Departments):

   - Engineering

   - Product

   - Marketing

   - Sales

   - Customer Success

2. **Assign default projects** for each department

3. **Set up project templates** for recurring work types

4. **Configure notification defaults** by role and department

## Step 4: Essential Integrations
