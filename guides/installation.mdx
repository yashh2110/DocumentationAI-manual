## Step 3: Team Setup

### Adding team members

There are several ways to add people to your workspace:

<CodeGroup tabs="Individual Invites,Bulk Import,SSO Provisioning">
```javascript
// Individual email invites
const inviteUsers = [
  {
    email: "john@acme.com",
    role: "member",
    projects: ["proj_123", "proj_456"]
  },
  {
    email: "admin@acme.com", 
    role: "admin",
    projects: "all"
  }
];

// Send invitations
inviteUsers.forEach(user => {
  sendInvitation(user);
});
```

```csv
# CSV bulk import format
email,role,department,projects
john.doe@acme.com,member,engineering,proj_123
jane.smith@acme.com,admin,product,all
bob.wilson@acme.com,viewer,marketing,proj_456
```

```xml
<!-- SCIM provisioning for enterprise -->
<scim:User>
  <scim:userName>john.doe@acme.com</scim:userName>
  <scim:name>
    <scim:givenName>John</scim:givenName>
    <scim:familyName>Doe</scim:familyName>
  </scim:name>
  <scim:emails>
    <scim:email primary="true">john.doe@acme.com</scim:email>
  </scim:emails>
</scim:User>
```
</CodeGroup>

### Role assignment strategy

Plan your role structure before adding team members:

**Recommended approach for most teams**:

| 10-50 people | 2-3 | Team leads + ICs | Contractors, clients |
| 50+ people | 3-5 | Department leads | Read-only stakeholders |

### Department and project organization

Organize team members by department and assign to relevant projects:

1. **Create departments** (Settings → Team → Departments):
   - Engineering
   - Product  
   - Marketing
   - Sales
   - Customer Success

2. **Assign default projects** for each department
3. **Set up project templates** for recurring work types
4. **Configure notification defaults** by role and department
