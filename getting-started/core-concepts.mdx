## Architecture Overview

ACME Company is built around four main concepts that work together seamlessly:

- **Workspaces** - Your team's central hub

- **Projects** - Organized work containers

- **Workflows** - Customizable process flows

- **Integrations** - Connected ecosystem

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your team's central hub where all collaboration happens. Think of it as your organization's digital headquarters.

### Key characteristics

- **Single source of truth** for all team activity

- **Unified permissions** and security settings

- **Shared integrations** across all projects

- **Consolidated billing** and usage analytics

<Callout uid="a9d0e39a-194e-4098-b7c1-0ef90adaaef2" kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Most teams need only one workspace, but larger organizations often create separate workspaces for different departments or business units.
</Callout>

    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Review API documentation',
    project_id: 'proj_123',
    assignee_id: 'user_456',
    due_date: '2024-02-15',
    priority: 'high'
  })
