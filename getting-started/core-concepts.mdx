---

Understanding these core concepts will help you make the most of ACME Company and use it effectively for your team's needs.

## Architecture Overview

ACME Company is built around four main concepts that work together seamlessly:

- **Workspaces** - Your team's central hub
- **Projects** - Organized work containers  
- **Workflows** - Customizable process flows
- **Integrations** - Connected ecosystem

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is your team's central hub where all collaboration happens. Think of it as your organization's digital headquarters.

### Key characteristics

- **Single source of truth** for all team activity
- **Unified permissions** and security settings
- **Shared integrations** across all projects
- **Consolidated billing** and usage analytics

<Callout kind="info">
  Most teams need only one workspace, but larger organizations often create separate workspaces for different departments or business units.
</Callout>

### Common workflow patterns

<CodeGroup tabs="Kanban Board,Development Sprint,Content Review">
```text
Kanban Workflow:
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Backlog │→│ To Do   │→│In Progress│→│  Done   │
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘

Best for: Continuous flow work
Examples: Support tickets, ongoing maintenance
```

```text
Sprint Workflow:
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│Planning │→│Development│→│ Testing │→│ Review  │→│Deployed │
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘

Best for: Software development cycles
Examples: Feature development, bug fixes
```

```text
Content Review Workflow:
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Draft   │→│ Review  │→│Revisions│→│Approved │→│Published│
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘

Best for: Content creation and approval
Examples: Blog posts, marketing materials
```
</CodeGroup>

### Workflow automation

Set up automatic actions to reduce manual work:

- **Auto-assign** tasks based on type or creator
- **Send notifications** when tasks enter specific stages
- **Update status** when related tasks are completed
- **Create follow-up tasks** automatically
- **Archive completed** work after a set time

## Team Collaboration

### Roles and permissions

ACME Company uses a flexible role-based system:

| Permission | Viewer | Member | Admin | Owner |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| View projects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create tasks | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit any task | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage projects | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Workspace settings | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Billing & usage | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Communication patterns

<Callout kind="tip">
  **@mention** team members in comments to ensure they see important updates. Use `@everyone` sparingly to avoid notification fatigue.
</Callout>

**Real-time collaboration**:
- Live cursor tracking when multiple people edit
- Instant comment notifications and responses  
- Automatic conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Activity feeds showing recent team actions

**Asynchronous collaboration**:
- Detailed comment threads on tasks and projects
- File attachments and link sharing
- Status updates and progress reports
- Email summaries for offline team members

## Integrations Ecosystem

### Native integrations

ACME Company connects with tools your team already uses:

**Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord  
**Development**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira  
**Design**: Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, InVision  
**Productivity**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Notion  
**Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude

### Integration patterns

<ExpandableGroup>
<Expandable title="Bidirectional Sync" default-open="true">

**How it works**: Changes in either platform automatically update the other

**Example**: GitHub pull requests create tasks in your project, and completing tasks updates the PR status

**Benefits**:
- No duplicate data entry
- Single source of truth across tools
- Automatic progress tracking

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Notification Hub" default-open="false">

**How it works**: ACME Company sends updates to your communication tools

**Example**: Slack notifications when tasks are completed, deadlines approach, or teammates need input

**Benefits**:
- Stay informed without checking multiple tools
- Configurable notification preferences  
- Reduced context switching

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Data Import/Export" default-open="false">

**How it works**: One-time or scheduled data transfers between platforms

**Example**: Import customer data from your CRM, export project reports to spreadsheets

**Benefits**:
- Migrate data from other tools
- Create custom reports and analysis
- Backup and compliance requirements

</Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

### API and webhooks

For custom integrations, use our comprehensive API:

```javascript
// Example: Create a task via API
const response = await fetch('https://api.acme.com/v1/tasks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Review API documentation',
    project_id: 'proj_123',
    assignee_id: 'user_456',
    due_date: '2024-02-15',
    priority: 'high'
  })
});

const task = await response.json();
console.log('Task created:', task.id);
```

## Data Architecture

### Security and privacy

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Access controls**: Role-based permissions with granular settings
- **Audit logs**: Complete activity tracking for compliance
- **Data residency**: Choose where your data is stored geographically

### Backup and recovery
