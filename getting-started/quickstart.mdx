2. **Add a comment**: `@mention` team members to get their attention

3. **Attach files**: Drag images, documents, or links

4. **Set up notifications**: Choose how you want to be updated

**Example comment with mentions**:

```text

@team - This will be ready for the next new hire on Monday.
```

## Step 6: Explore key features

### Dashboard and analytics

Navigate to your **Dashboard** to see:
